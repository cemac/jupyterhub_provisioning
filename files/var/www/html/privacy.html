    <h4>JupyterHub Specific Information</h4>
    <p>
      The JupyterHub service is intended for teaching purposes.
    </p><p>
      Data is stored of any one who chooses to use the service. There are two
      types of data: (A) Administrative metadata consists of username,
      information about currently running servers, and technical logging
      information, and (B) the user’s own data stored on drives, of which they
      are the controller.
    </p><p>
      Your (A) data consists of your username along with technical information
      about currently running servers and past usage. All other account
      information is not stored by the JupyterHub service, and our local copy
      of administrative metadata is removed when a course is no longer active.
    </p><p>
      Your (B) data is stored for as long as a course is active.
    </p><p>
      Copies of (A) and (B) may be archived and remain in back up systems after
      a course has ended.
    </p>
    <h4>Contact</h4>
    <p>
      The JupyterHub service is currently managed by the CEMAC staff within the
      School of Earth and Environment.
    </p><p>
      If you have any queries relating to this privacy notice or the way your
      data is being processed through this website then please contact

      response please contact the University Webmaster, webmaster at leeds dot
